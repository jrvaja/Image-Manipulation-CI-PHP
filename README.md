Image-Manipulation-CI-PHP
=========================

This lib contain different Option to play with Images.

Thins is simple and short code for few operation on IMAGE.

Features : 

1. upload Image
2. resize image ratio vise
3. Create rounded/circle thumb of the image
4. Merge image (like a frame of an image)
 
I have used CI library to upload image.

For other feature,it's a pure PHP code, so you can implement for any PHP Framework.

Just few things to consider before this implementation:

1. You must have enble gd library
2. You must have enble Imagick library
 
That's it.

Note: 
I have made these function for CodeIgniter.But other than "testimg" function works for all other framework(or PHP).
